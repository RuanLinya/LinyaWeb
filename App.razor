@using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Routing

<!--
  The root component for the Blazor Server application.  It defines the
  router used to resolve incoming URLs to Razor components.  Since this
  project presents a single résumé/portfolio page, the router simply
  delegates to the Index component and falls back to a not‑found message.
